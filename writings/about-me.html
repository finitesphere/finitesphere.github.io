                <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
                <p>My name is Connor, and I am a software engineer. I am passionate about programming, reading, and video games.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>What is the purpose of this website?</strong></p>
                <p>The purpose of this website is to document my projects and thoughts.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>Why did you take an interest in computer science?</strong></p>
                <p>I remember watching my older brother play video games on his PlayStation 3 when I was young. Whenever he invited me to join a game that had co-op, I always got the crummy GameStop exclusive PlayStation 3 controller. There was noticeable input lag, even though the controller was wired, the buttons were smaller, and it wasn't as comfortable as the standard PlayStation 3 controller. But what really piqued my interest was the controller's transparent case. Seeing the inner workings fascinated me, and that sparked my desire to understand how technology works.</p>
                
                <p>From there, I begged my parents to get me a desktop computer. Eventually, my mom’s friend gave me an old Apple Mac Pro from 2006. While it didn't have the latest specs, I loved it because I could play games like Minecraft and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and I could browse the web. I tinkered with the computer, but not with the hardware—rather, with the software. The 2006 Mac came with macOS, which, like all Apple operating systems, is UNIX-based. I was introduced to the terminal and worked with many UNIX commands to operate the machine. Instead of staring at the rainbow wheel when I wanted to access a file, I could just change directories and open the file using the terminal. GUI was out, CLI was in!</p>
                
                <p>During high school, I joined the IT department, where I worked mostly on hardware and occasionally on software. The work primarily involved repairing broken Chromebooks and smart screen projectors. While the tasks were repetitive, they taught me a lot about hardware and how computers function. I was also referred to as the "Linux guru" because of my knowledge of UNIX commands. Although most of the work orders were for teachers' laptops that ran Windows 10, the Chromebooks used ChromeOS, which is UNIX-based. Whenever a problem involved the terminal, I was the go-to person for fixing it. Most of the issues were networking problems or Chromebooks needing a clean reinstall of ChromeOS, which required terminal work. I even repurposed an old, broken Chromebook that the school was going to throw out by installing Arch Linux on it. The performance wasn’t great, but I enjoyed the challenge of installing my favorite Linux distribution on the Chromebook.</p>

                <p>I became fascinated with everything UNIX-based and eventually discovered Linux distributions. I now dual boot both Arch Linux and Windows 10. I started with Bash scripting and later moved to programming in C. Currently, I primarily code in Java, as it’s the preferred language at my university—and seemingly at every university in the United States. While I still appreciate C and UNIX for their simplicity, I’ve grown fond of Java, object-oriented programming, and JUnit testing.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong></p>
                <p>You can see what I've worked on and what I’m currently working on by going to the projects page of my website. I recently discovered the Godot game engine and GDScript, which I’m using to develop my game Gnome Conquest. I’ve also created a simple log-posting software using Python.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>Why 'Finite Sphere'?</strong></p>
                <p>I thought the name sounded pretty cool! I also learned about the mathematical theory of finite sphere packing, which added an interesting layer to the name.</p>
